# AI Assistant with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

An intelligent question-answering system powered by Google's FLAN-T5 language model and RAG technology. This application allows you to ask questions about your documents and get accurate, context-aware answers based on your own content.

## Features

- ** FLAN-T5 Language Model**: Uses Google's FLAN-T5-Small for natural language understanding and generation
- ** Document Processing**: Automatically processes PDF, TXT, and DOCX files
- ** Smart Retrieval**: Uses semantic search to find relevant content from your documents
- ** Offline Capability**: Works completely offline after initial setup
- ** Fast Performance**: Embeddings are cached for instant loading on subsequent runs
- ** Context-Aware Answers**: Provides answers with source citations and relevance scores
- ** Chat Interface**: Clean, intuitive Streamlit interface for natural conversations

## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an AI technique that combines:
1. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from your documents
2. **Generation**: Using that information to generate accurate answers

This means the AI answers questions based on YOUR documents, not generic knowledge.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- 500MB free disk space (for models)
- Internet connection (only for first-time setup)

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Clone or download this repository, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: If you encounter issues with `python-docx`, run:
```bash
pip uninstall docx python-docx -y
pip install python-docx
```

### 2. Add Your Documents

Create a `documents/` folder (or use the auto-created one) and add your files:

```
your_project/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
└── documents/          ← Add your files here
    ├── document1.pdf
    ├── document2.txt
    └── document3.docx
```

**Supported formats**: PDF, TXT, DOCX

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will:
- Download models on first run (~400MB total)
- Automatically detect and process your documents
- Create embeddings and save them for future use
- Launch in your browser

### 4. Start Asking Questions!

Simply type your questions in the chat interface and get answers based on your documents.

## Usage Examples

### Example Questions:

**For a company policy document:**
- "What is the vacation policy?"
- "How do I submit expense reports?"
- "What are the working hours?"

**For research papers:**
- "What methodology was used in this study?"
- "What were the main findings?"
- "Who are the authors?"

**For technical documentation:**
- "How do I install this software?"
- "What are the system requirements?"
- "How do I configure the API?"

**For legal documents:**
- "What are the payment terms?"
- "What is the termination clause?"
- "Who are the parties in this agreement?"

## Interface Guide

### Sidebar Controls

- **Status Bar**: Shows system status and number of processed chunks

## Project Structure

```
your_project/
├── app.py                      # Main application file
├── requirements.txt            # Python dependencies
├── README.md                   # This file
├── documents/                  # Your documents (you create this)
│   ├── file1.pdf
│   ├── file2.txt
│   └── file3.docx
├── saved_models/               # Downloaded models (auto-created)

│   └── embeddings.pkl
```

## Configuration

### Models Used

- **T5 Model**: `google/flan-t5-small` (~300MB)
  - Best balance of speed and quality
  - Good for everyday questions
  
- **Embedding Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (~90MB)
  - Fast semantic search
  - Accurate relevance matching

### Customization

You can modify these settings in `app.py`:

```python
DEFAULT_MODEL = "google/flan-t5-small"  # Change to flan-t5-base for better quality
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"    # Keep this for best performance
```

**Available T5 variants:**
- `google/flan-t5-small` - 300MB, fastest
- `google/flan-t5-base` - 1GB, better quality
- `google/flan-t5-large` - 3GB, best quality (requires more RAM)

## Performance Tips

1. **First Run**: Takes 2-5 minutes to download models and process documents
2. **Subsequent Runs**: Loads in 10-15 seconds (embeddings are cached)
3. **Adding Documents**: Click "Reprocess Documents" after adding new files
4. **Chunk Size**: Default 500 words works well for most documents
5. **Retrieved Chunks**: Start with 3, increase if answers lack context

## Offline Usage

After the first successful run with internet:

1. All models are saved locally
2. Embeddings are cached
3. **No internet required**
4. Works completely offline

Perfect for:
- Secure environments
- Air-gapped systems
- Working without internet
- Privacy-sensitive documents

## Troubleshooting

### "SentencePiece not found"
```bash
pip install sentencepiece
```

### "python-docx error"
```bash
pip uninstall docx python-docx -y
pip install python-docx
```

### "No documents processed"
- Make sure files are in the `documents/` folder
- Check file formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX only)
- Click "🔄 Process Documents" if auto-processing failed

### "Model loading failed"
- Check internet connection (first run only)
- Ensure you have 500MB free disk space
- Try deleting `saved_models/` folder and restart

### Poor Quality Answers
- Increase "Retrieved Chunks" slider
- Make sure your documents contain relevant information
- Try rephrasing your question more specifically
- Consider upgrading to `flan-t5-base` for better quality

### Slow Performance
- Reduce "Retrieved Chunks" to 1-2
- Use fewer/smaller documents
- Ensure models are saved locally (check `saved_models/` folder)

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Document Processing**
   - Extracts text from PDF/TXT/DOCX files
   - Splits into 500-word chunks with 50-word overlap
   - Creates vector embeddings for semantic search

2. **Question Answering**
   - Converts your question to a vector embedding
   - Finds most similar document chunks (cosine similarity)
   - Passes relevant chunks + question to T5
   - T5 generates answer based on provided context

3. **Caching**
   - Models cached in `saved_models/`
   - Embeddings cached in `embeddings/embeddings.pkl`
   - Fast loading on subsequent runs

### Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Web interface
- **Transformers**: T5 model loading and inference
- **Sentence-Transformers**: Semantic embeddings
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework
- **PyPDF2**: PDF text extraction
- **python-docx**: DOCX text extraction
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations

## Privacy & Security

- **100% Local**: All processing happens on your machine
- **No Cloud**: Documents never leave your computer
- **No API Calls**: No external services used
- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet
- **Your Data**: Complete control over your documents
